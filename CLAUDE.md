# offboard_py — Multi-agent offboard drone control for PX4 autopilot

## Architecture
See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for node graph and data flow.

## Session Workflow Protocol

At the **START** of each session:
- Read `doc/active/feature_list.json` and `doc/active/progress.txt`
- Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` for node boundaries and topic wiring

At the **END** of each session:
- Append to `doc/active/progress.txt`: what was done, what's next
- Update `doc/active/feature_list.json` if any feature status changed
- Update the relevant node's `CONTEXT.md` if its interface (topics, services, parameters) changed
- Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` if node dependencies or topic wiring changed

## Node Navigation
Each node has a `CONTEXT.md` describing its purpose, subscriptions, publishers, services, parameters, and dependencies. Read the relevant `CONTEXT.md` before working on a node.

## Specs
Authoritative specifications live in `doc/*_spec.md`. These define *what* to build. Do not duplicate spec content elsewhere.
